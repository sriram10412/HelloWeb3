# SRE/Devops Challenge

## Overview
This challenge involves deploying a Node.js application that monitors the Polygon blockchain's block height on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using Terraform and CI/CD. The task will assess your skills in cloud infrastructure management, container orchestration, application deployment, monitoring, and automation.

## Prerequisites
- API Key from polygonscan.com (it is free)  https://polygonscan.com/register
- Get Access to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and the claim $300 free credits
    https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier/#free-trial.
- Familiarity with Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana, and GitHub Actions.

## Objectives
- Provision a GKE cluster in a dedicated VPC using Terraform.
- Containerize and deploy a provided Node.js application to GKE.
- Set up Prometheus and Grafana in the cluster for monitoring.
- Ensure the application and Grafana dashboard are publicly accessible.

## Task Details

### 1. GCP Project Setup
- Create a new project on GCP.
- Claim the $300 free credits.

### 2. Terraform Setup for GKE
- Use existing Terraform modules or create a minimal setup for provisioning a VPC and GKE cluster.
- Optionally, set up an IAM role for a read-only Kubernetes user.

### 3. Node.js Application Setup
- Fork or clone the [BCWResearch/HelloWeb3](https://github.com/BCWResearch/HelloWeb3) repository.
- Register for an API key from [PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/).
- Create a Dockerfile for the application.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for building and pushing the Docker image.

### 4. Helm Chart and Deployment
- Develop a Helm chart for the application.
- Deploy the application to GKE using CI/CD.
- Ensure public accessibility and metrics exposure on port 3000.

### 5. Prometheus and Grafana Deployment
- Deploy Prometheus in the GKE cluster.
- Deploy Grafana with external access (IP or DNS) and SSL.
- Configure Grafana for metrics visualization.

## Deliverables
- A GitHub repository with Dockerfile, Helm chart, CI/CD configuration, and Terraform code.
- Public URLs for the application and Grafana dashboard.
- Documentation on the setup process and access details.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Application deployment functionality.
- Metrics integration in Grafana.
- Best practices in Terraform, Kubernetes, monitoring, and CI/CD.
- Documentation quality.

## Additional Resources
- Terraform, GitHub CI, and Helm references are provided in this repository to illustrate the basic structure. Feel free to modify these as needed.

## Submission Guidelines
- Ensure all deliverables are committed to your repository.
- Provide clear documentation in the repository.
- Submit the repository URL upon completion.

Good luck!




Thanks for this opportunity . I tried upto my knowledge and i can realize still i need to complete lot of test. Since i am new to GCP and GKE clusters , i am not having much idea to resolve them.
